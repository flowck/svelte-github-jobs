# Github Jobs



![Github Jobs](./page.gif)


This repository contains a frontend web application that re-implements Github's jobs page using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Why

It was a practical way to test Svelt in a project that is not exactly a todo list app.

This project covers the following techniques:

* Web components
* Life-cycle hooks
* Asynchronous operations with `async/await` and `Promises`
* Custom events
